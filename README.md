### TODO
* Find the correct format of international phone numbers to send to the API.
* Refactor and fix drag and drop selection bad behavior
* Abstract component BookingForm for further sub-components
* Test all components integraty with [JEST](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)

### Comments
I had some difficulty understanding what the correct format would be for sending the phone number to the api, and because of that the SMS receipt may not be working properly. I believe that a contact with the backend developer would easily solve this problem. I'm not very satisfied with the final result, but I believe that according to the time available to take the test the result is fair. Thank you for the opportunity and I hope we can continue with the selection process!
